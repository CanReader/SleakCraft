## Branches

`staging` is the testing layer between a change and `main`. Everything lands in `staging` first, gets tested there, and reaches `main` only when `staging` is merged into it.

| Branch | Holds | Accepts |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `staging` | Changes being tested | Pull requests from any branch, once CI passes |
| `main` | Tested, released code | Pull requests from `staging` only, once CI passes |

Open every pull request against `staging`. A pull request into `main` from any other branch fails the **Only staging merges into main** check and cannot be merged. To fix it, edit the pull request and change its base branch to `staging`.

---

## Testing in staging

Every pull request into `staging` runs the full CI: the Linux and Windows build matrix, the shader check, and the headless smoke test.

Every push to `staging` also leaves a playable Release build. Open the CI run for the latest `staging` commit in the Actions tab and download `SleakCraft-staging-Windows` or `SleakCraft-staging-Linux` from the bottom of the page. The builds are kept for 14 days.

## Releasing staging to main

1. Open a pull request from `staging` into `main`.
2. Wait for CI to pass.
3. Merge it with **Create a merge commit**.

`main` only allows merge commits. Squash and rebase copy staging's commits into new ones, so the two branches would stop sharing history, and every later release would replay old commits and hit conflicts that aren't real.

After a release, GitHub shows `staging` as behind `main`. The commits it is missing are the release merge commits, which change nothing on their own and need no action.

## Branch protection

The rules are the JSON files in `.github/rulesets/`, which GitHub imports as they are: **Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New ruleset → Import a ruleset**.

| Rule | `main` | `staging` |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Changes arrive by pull request only | ✓ | ✓ |
| No force pushes, no deletion | ✓ | ✓ |
| CI must pass | ✓ | ✓ |
| Source must be `staging` | ✓ | |
| Merge method | Merge commit | Any |

> **Setting it up?** Import `main.json` only after `.github/workflows/branch-policy.yml` is on `main`. The ruleset requires the check that workflow reports, so until the workflow exists nothing can merge into `main`. **Allow merge commits** must stay on under Settings → General → Pull Requests.

Neither ruleset requires an approving review, because GitHub does not let authors approve their own pull requests. Raise `required_approving_review_count` once there is a second maintainer.

Nobody can bypass the rules, admins included. To get out of a jam, set the ruleset's enforcement to **Disabled**, fix the problem, then set it back to **Active**.

Required checks are matched by name, so renaming a job in `ci.yml` or `branch-policy.yml` means updating the rulesets to match.
